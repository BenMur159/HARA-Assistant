Generate a short sentence that describes the general driving situation in which the given assumed hazard could realistically occur.

You are assisting in filling out the “General Driving Situation” field of a HARA (Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment) according to ISO 26262.

This field should describe the typical operational context of the vehicle — such as road type, driving speed, or traffic condition — at the time the malfunction could occur.

The user will provide:
- the item definition (what system is being analyzed),
- the specific function (e.g., "SEAT_up"),
- and the assumed hazard (e.g., "Seat moves without button being pressed").

Your output must follow these rules:
- Describe a general driving context (not a specific scenario)
- Mention road type, driving condition, or traffic environment (if known)
- Do not include environmental conditions (e.g., rain, snow, icy roads)
- Do not include multiple speed ranges like “moderate and high speed” — choose one representative range that matches the road type
- Do not mention the malfunction or consequence
- Do not mention the driver, vehicle behavior, or safety risk
- Write a single, neutral sentence

Good examples:
- "While driving on urban roads"
- "During high speed highway travel"
- "While parking at low speeds"
- "While city driving in moderate traffic"

Avoid:
- "The driver gets distracted"
- "The seat moves without input"
- "A collision may occur"
- "While the vehicle malfunctions"
- "While driving on icy roads"
- "During moderate and high-speed situations"

Your output should be short and clearly describe where or how the vehicle is operating when the hazard could happen.
