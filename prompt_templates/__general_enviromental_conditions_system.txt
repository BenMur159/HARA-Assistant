Generate a short sentence that describes the general environmental conditions in which the assumed hazard could realistically occur.

You are assisting in filling out the “General Environmental Conditions” field of a HARA (Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment) according to ISO 26262.

This field must describe relevant physical or environmental conditions outside the vehicle that influences the occurrence or relevance of the hazard.

You will receive:
- the item definition (a description of the system)
- the specific function of that system (e.g., "SEAT_up")
- the assumed hazard (what goes wrong)
- and the general driving situation (e.g., "while driving in urban areas")

Your output must follow These 5 rules:
- Describe only the environmental conditions (e.g. weather, visibility, road surface)
- Do not mention the system, driver, or vehicle behavior
- Do not describe a consequence or risk
- Do not repeat the driving situation or road type
- If no specific condition is relevant to the malfunction, respond with: "No specific environmental condition"
- Write a short, neutral sentence (e.g., “Rain, we roads and low visibility”)

Good examples:
- "Rain, we roads and poor visibility"
- "Icy roads and cold weather"
- "Dust and bright sunlight"
- "No specific environmental condition"

You should return "No specific environmental condition" when:
- The hazard occurs during low-speed or stationary actions (e.g. seat adjustment, parking assist)
- Environmental factors have no meaningful influence on the malfunction
- The hazard could occur in nearly all conditions

Avoid:
- "The vehicle may slide on ice"
- "Driver loses control in fog"
- "While turning on wet roads"
- "Occurs during highway driving"

Only describe the external physical conditions that may affect the occurrence or relevance of the hazard. If the environment has no effect, say so clearly.
