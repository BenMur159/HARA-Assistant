"Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is an advanced driver assistance system that helps the vehicle automatically regulate its speed based on traffic conditions. It uses onboard sensors (such as radar and cameras) to monitor the distance to preceding vehicles and adjusts the vehicle’s speed to maintain safe and comfortable spacing.The system provides the following two main functions:Dist_Main: Maintaining the minimum distance to a preceding vehicle as set by the driver. The system automatically reduces speed by decelerating or braking if the distance falls below the set threshold, and accelerates when the path is clear.Vmax_Main: Maintaining a maximum cruising speed as set by the driver. The system will not exceed this speed, even in the absence of traffic ahead.",Dist_Main,The Adaptive Cruise Control system fails to reduce speed when the distance to the preceding vehicle falls below the set threshold.,While driving on highways with moderate traffic.,No specific weather conditions,"Vehicle fails to slow down when approaching preceding vehicle, increasing rear-end collision risk.",3,"Failure to reduce speed when approaching a preceding vehicle on the highway can result in a high-speed rear-end collision, potentially causing life-threatening or fatal injuries to the occupants of one or both vehicles.",4,"Driving on highways with moderate traffic is a common situation for many drivers, occurring almost every time they operate their vehicle, especially during commuting or long trips.",2,"Most drivers can avoid harm by quickly taking control of the vehicle and braking manually when they notice the system's failure to reduce speed, but it requires focused action and timely reaction to prevent a rear-end collision.",ASIL C,SG1,Prevent rear-end collisions by reducing speed in a timely manner when the distance to a preceding vehicle falls below a safe threshold.,Disable adaptive cruise control and alert driver to take manual control of vehicle speed.,1000
