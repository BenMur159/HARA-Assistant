"Item Definition: Seat Adjustment System. The system adjusts the driver’s seat via two buttons: one for vertical (up/down) and one for horizontal (forward/backward) movement. It provides four functions: 1.) SEAT_up: Move seat up while button is pressed; stop at button release or upper rail limit.\n 2.) SEAT_down: Move seat down while button is pressed; stop at button release or lower rail limit.\n 3.) SEAT_forward: Move seat forward while button is pressed; stop at button release or forward rail limit.\n 4.) SEAT_backward: Move seat backward while button is pressed; stop at button release or rear rail limit.\n Movement is electromechanical and bounded by contact sensors.", "SEAT_up", "seat not adjusting even though button pressed (no reaction on driver input)", "Parking", "all", "driver wants to adjust seat but seat is not reacting", "0", "no moving parts, and the car is not moving", "2", "only change the seat position every few times when the car is started", "0", "if the seat position cannot be adjusted, the driver can choose to not start driving", "QM", "", "QM-no safty goal", "QM-no safe state", ""
